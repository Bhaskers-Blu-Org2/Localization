In July 2016, Microsoft announced [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com), the new home for Microsoft technical documentation. Enterprise Mobility products were the first ones to be featured there, but today almost all products are hosted - you can read about new products and new features being added on the [Team Blog](https://docs.microsoft.com/teamblog/).

All documentation on [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/) is **Open Sourced** and designed to allow **Community Contributions**. 

Community Contributions can be submitted for the original documentation in English as well as on the localized articles.

International users have now the opportunity, through their contributions and feedback, to both improve the quality of the localized documentation and to trigger content changes to the original article. 


## How to contribute (in 5 easy steps)

As you browse through the documentation, you will notice that in each article that allows contributions you now have an Edit hyperlink. To suggest a change:

1. Click the **Edit** button, you will be redirected to the localized documentation article in the public repository.

2. If you are not already signed in to GitHub, please do. If you don't have an account, you can easily sign-up for a free one. After the first time, this step will not be required anymore as you will already be signed in.

A few automated checks will be triggered prior to the submission and you may be required to digitally sign a CLA ([Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/)). It's very easy, just follow the guided steps.

A pool of trusted moderators reviews, approves, or rejects the submitted changes to ensure the linguistic and technical accuracy of the suggestions. Once a moderator approves a suggestion, it will be displayed on the site and the contributor GitHub avatar will be shown on the published topic as one of the contributors to the page.
If approved, you should expect to see your suggestions implemented in a few days, *however* this may vary based on the number of suggestions you submitted and on the overall volume of submissions. If you don't get a reply in 2 weeks, please do let us know by filing an [Issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/Localization/issues)
